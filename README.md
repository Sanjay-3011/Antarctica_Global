# 📊 Associate Performance Analysis – Antarctica Global  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the performance of three business development associates over a two-month period.  
The study focuses on lead generation efficiency, productivity trends, time management, review attendance impact, and incomplete lead tracking.  

The analysis combines **Power BI (Power Query)** for data preprocessing, cleaning, and dashboarding, with **Python** for advanced analytics and validation.  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Power BI** – Data preprocessing, modeling (Fact & Dim tables), and static dashboard creation  
- **Python** – Data analysis and statistical validation  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `sklearn`  

---

## 📊 Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** (Power Query)  
  - Anomaly detection & handling  
  - Fact_LeadGeneration & Dim_Associate tables (Star Schema)  
  - Holiday detection and row filtering  
- **Statistical Analysis (Python)**  
  - Efficiency calculation  
  - Performance variability (Std Dev)  
  - Time vs Leads correlation  
  - Review attendance impact  
  - Consistency (Coefficient of Variation)  
  - Regression-based prediction and trend analysis  
- **Power BI Dashboard**  
  - 3 static pages (Ali, Arya, Raj)  
  - Required visualizations (Performance trends, heatmap, time distribution, etc.)  
  - Enhanced charts: *Quality vs Efficiency Balance* & *Efficiency Leaderboard*  
  - KPI Cards: Total Leads & Time Spent  

---

## 🚀 Results & Insights  
- **Arya** was the most efficient associate (**0.09 efficiency**).  
- **Ali** showed the highest performance variability (**Std Dev = 3.52**).  
- **Raj** demonstrated the strongest improvement in reducing incomplete leads.  
- Review attendance positively impacted lead generation (**+5–10%**).  
- Optimal time for lead generation: **300–360 mins/day**.

## ✅ Recommendations  
### Actionable Steps  
- ⏱ **Time Allocation Guidelines** – Set optimal time benchmarks to balance speed & quality  
- 📉 **Incomplete Lead Tracking** – Establish reduction targets with quarterly monitoring  
- ⭐ **Lead Quality Scoring** – Implement systematic scoring for prioritization & follow-up  

### Long-Term Strategies  
- 🔄 **Strategic Workload Reallocation** – Assign high-value leads to efficient associates  
- 📅 **Weekend/Weekday Optimization** – Develop tailored strategies based on performance patterns  
- ⌛ **Flexible Scheduling** – Align work hours with peak productivity
